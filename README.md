## Hey You!

### Getting bored of writing the same React prototype boilerplate...

### Found that other prototype tools don't actually help?

Yeah *me too* so I put this together, check it out as a new project and prototype away. Comes with a bit of Bulma for css, Redux and of course hot-reloading-react-niceness.

I will probably add some more stuff in due course, like scss maybe but yeah, this is doing the job for now.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/royletron/react-protogen name-of-awesome-prototype
cd name-of-awesome-prototype
npm i
bower install
```

**If you don't already use Bower, be sure to install it beforehand**

```bash
npm i -g bower
```

Boom!
